As a result, the error signal can be calculated without low-pass filters and time delays, and the position estimation performance can be enhanced. Using the proposed method, the performance of the sensorless control can be enhanced; the bandwidth of the current controller was enhanced up to 250 Hz, and that of the speed controller was up to 50 Hz.},

An observer is built according to the back electromotive force (EMF) model after the back EMF equivalent signal is obtained. In this way, not only are low-pass filter and phase compensation module eliminated, but also estimation accuracy is improved. Numerical simulations and experiments with an 11-kW low-speed PMSM are carried out. The results demonstrate that the novel SMO can effectively estimate rotor position and speed and achieve good static and dynamic performance.},

  abstract = {A high-frequency (HF) voltage injection method can accurately estimate the rotor position of an interior permanent magnet synchronous motor at low speed. However, the fixed injection frequency for the traditional HF voltage injection method will produce a loud audible noise that limits the actual application of HF voltage injection method. In order to reduce the audible noise, a novel HF square-wave voltage injection method with the random switching frequency is proposed in this article. The frequency of the injected HF voltage varies with the random switching frequency, so it can effectively spread power spectrum caused by HF current and pulsewidth modulation (PWM), which will effectively reduce the audible noise caused by the HF current and PWM. Additionally, the power spectral density of the HF current based on the proposed method is analyzed to verify the effectiveness in reducing audible noise. Then, a corresponding demodulation method for induced HF current is presented. Finally, the experimental results show that the proposed method has continuous spectra and the audible noises can be suppressed significantly.},

  abstract = {To control PM brushless DC motors, position and speed sensors are indispensable because the current should be controlled depending on the rotor position. However, these sensors are undesirable from standpoints of size, cost, maintenance, and reliability. There are different ways of approaching this problem, depending on the flux distribution. The paper presents the speed and position sensorless control of PM brushless DC motors with a sinusoidal flux distribution. Two approaches are presented and compared with each other; one is based on the voltage model of the motor and another is based on the current model. The starting procedure is also a very difficult problem under sensorless drives, because the sensorless drive algorithm uses voltage and current for estimation of rotor position, but no information is available before starting. A novel starting method is presented by using a salient-pole machine. Experimental results based on DSP-TMS320C25 controller are shown for comparisons, which demonstrate desired characteristics both in steady-state and starting conditions.},

However, distortions such as a dc offset and low-order harmonics are contained in the estimated ﬂux due to various reasons. In this paper, a distortion-minimizing ﬂux observer is proposed to suppress the effects of dc offset and harmonics by implementing frequency-adaptive observers. The proposed frequency-adaptive ﬂux observer is designed to extract a fundamental ﬂux while keeping a simple structure even if the rotating speed of the IPMSM varies. The fundamental ﬂux could be estimated by the proposed current- and voltage-model based ﬂux observer, which is implemented with the frequency-adaptive observer and harmonic extractors. Moreover, parameter sensitivity and model transition are discussed to improve the performance of the proposed observers. The validity and effectiveness of the proposed methods are veriﬁed with simulation and experimental results.},
