In this paper, the effects of inverter nonlinearity and sampling current dc bias on back EMF estimation are analyzed. A voltage feedforward compensation method based on an iterative learning control (ILC) algorithm is proposed and it is used to eliminate the harmonics of estimated back EMFs and position estimation error, so as to improve the performance of sensorless control. Compensated voltages at different rotor positions are calculated online by the ILC algorithm and stored in a lookup table. The method does not depend on current polarity and inverter model. And it is simple and easy to implement. The effectiveness of the proposed compensation method is verified by experiments.},

It is shown that the conventional technique using parameter information instantly extracted from premeasured parameter look-up tables (LUTs) only determines the local maximum torque per ampere (MTPA) operating point associated with this specific parameter information without evaluating the global MTPA achievement. Therefore, global MTPA operation may not be achieved for conventional online control IPMSM drives with extreme nonlinear machine parameters (e.g., short-period overload operations). Thus, a model-based correction method using stator flux adjustment is proposed for an online quasiglobal MTPA achievement. It is also proven that in the flux weakening (FW) region, due to the inverter nonlinearities, a lower than expected maximum achievable torque for a demanded speed and a higher than expected current magnitude for a demanded torque may be obtained. Hence, an inverter nonlinearity compensation (INC) method exploiting the voltage feedback (FB) loop is introduced and its advantages over the conventional INC scheme are demonstrated. The proposed online control method is validated via measurements on a 10-kW IPMSM.},

  abstract = {This paper addresses the inverter nonlinearity of a three-level T-type inverter. The main causes of the nonlinearity are pulse shaping, pulse skipping due to narrow pulses for the dead time, and voltage drop of the switching devices. Although the same causes have existed in two-level inverters, the pulse skipping phenomenon and results are quite different in the case of the three-level T-type inverter. The effects of pulse shaping and skipping have been investigated and discussed. In addition, the voltage drop of the switching devices has been considered in conjunction with the conduction path of the T-type inverter. Compensation methods based on the pulse width modulation (PWM) of T-type inverter to alleviate the inverter nonlinearity have been proposed from research results. The proposed methods could be easily implemented by adding appropriate offset voltages to the voltage references of the inverter in PWM. Furthermore, a neutral voltage balancing method of a three-level T-type inverter has been proposed in conjunction with the proposed PWM methods using offset voltage. Through extensive experimental tests, the fifth- and seventh-harmonic components of the current are conspicuously reduced along with the even harmonics. The neutral voltage of the inverter can be balanced effectively with the proposed offset voltage adjustments as well.},

  abstract = {It is a difficult to accurately estimate the rotor position in a surface permanent magnet synchronous motor (SPMSM), especially for low speed conditions because the back electromotive force (EMF) is almost zero. In this paper, an improved sliding mode observer (SMO) with a continuous sliding mode switching function (which could reduce the chattering effect) is proposed to estimate the real-time rotor position at a low speed. Through the introduction of an intermediate variable H, the back EMF is extended at low speed, which could improve the estimation accuracy for the rotor position. In addition, the chattering phenomenon is reduced by redesigning the sliding switching function. On the other hand, inverter nonlinearity also results in torque ripple and deteriorates the drive performance because of the harmonic components in the three-phase stator current. Here, a generalized sliding discrete Fourier transform (GSDFT) strategy is studied to extract the harmonic components, which can then be compensated with the corresponding compensation voltage calculated from the motor mathematical model. With the proposed strategy, the estimation accuracy can be apparently restricted when the rotor speed is lower than 50 rpm, while the chattering effect is also improved. With the nonlinearity compensation, the total harmonic distortion obviously decreases, which can improve the rotor estimation and the torque performance. In addition, the GSDFT algorithm executes in approximately half the time of the SDFT compensation method.},

The inverter nonlinearity leads to the generation of signals that corrupt the useful position information. The resulting effect differs depending on the injection approach utilized in the drive. Various compensation techniques to overcome this effect have been published in the literature. This paper is concerned with the zero-vector current-derivative technique. The effect of the varying ON-state resistance of the inverter power devices on the position signal is investigated in detail. Knowledge of the source of the corrupting signals facilitates compensation and determines its applicability. Two approaches for inverter nonlinearity compensation are compared. The first approach utilizes a lookup table from offline-processed data, while the second one is a simpler approach based on the current-dependent resistance characteristic of the inverter switching devices. Experimental performance under sensorless condition is shown for both approaches.},

In order to reduce the chattering of the SMO, an adaptive law is presented to help estimate the back electromotive forces of an SPMSM; thus, smaller gains can be set for switching functions of the SMO. The small-signal model of the proposed sensorless scheme is derived for analyzing the steady-state and dynamic behavior of the sensorless scheme. Voltage distortion, caused by nonlinear characteristics of switching devices, not only causes (6k ± 1)th harmonics in phase currents but also leads to a rotor position estimation error. The equivalent amplitude of the voltage distortion can be identified based on the derived small-signal model of the proposed sensorless scheme. To improve the accuracy of the estimated voltage distortion, a recursive restricted total least squares is applied to obtain the estimated amplitude of the voltage distortion. Experimental results validate the proposed sensorless control scheme and its effectiveness.},

Then the disturbance voltage is estimated by subtracting the constructed voltage model from the current controller output. The proposed method compensates for all of the inverter nonlinearity factors at the same time. All the processes in estimating distortions are independent of the dead time and power device parameters.

Hence, this paper proposes an offline identification method for resistance and dq-axis inductance surface by considering the inverter nonlinearity characteristics. A variable amplitude square-wave injection (VASI) scheme is proposed for the dq-axis inductance identification. The VASI method achieves the inductance identification with a novel data sampling strategy. Meanwhile, it can also establish the inductance surfaces by only a few identified data points with a polynomial fitting algorithm, which greatly reduces the identification time compared with the existing methods. The resistance identification is realized by a slope signal injection method, in which the effect of IGBT voltage drop is analyzed. In order to improve the identification accuracy, the inverter nonlinearities are compensated by a self-learning method considering the zero-axis voltage at different rotor positions. At the same time, the sampling error in zero current zones (ZCZs) of abc phases is researched. In order to verify the effectiveness and generality, the proposed method is carried out on two different test machines and confirmed by finite element analysis (FEA).},
